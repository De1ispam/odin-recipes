Nick's Thoughts Thurs Dec 01 2022
    
    Currently I am feeling strong in my HTML and 
    CSS for this part of The Odin Project (TOP) 
    however I am still apprehensive and slowed 
    down by my current poor understanding of Git 
    and Linux. 

    I have improved on Linux since starting TOP
    but I am having to google much to get by.

    I have been also working on FREECODECAMP.com
    to advance my knowledge before walking through
    lessons in TOP.

    I hope by the end of the introductory course of
    TOP to have a better understanding of exactly 
    what I'm doing in GIT and to be able to do the 
    nuts and bolts HTML sections without much
    frustration.
